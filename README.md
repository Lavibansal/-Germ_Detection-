# 🧼 Smart Hand Hygiene Monitoring & Germ Detection System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Smart Hand Hygiene Monitoring & Germ Detection System** enhances hand hygiene compliance in healthcare settings by combining **IoT-enabled smart dispensers** with **AI-powered germ detection**. This system ensures that healthcare workers follow hygiene protocols, reducing **healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)** and improving **patient safety**. It also provides **before and after cleanliness analysis** using **image processing** to measure germ reduction.  

## ⚙️ How It Works
-1️⃣ Upload two images (before cleaning and after cleaning)
-2️⃣ AI processes images using grayscale conversion, thresholding, and 
   contour detection
-3️⃣ Computes a cleanliness score (%)
-4️⃣ Displays germ-affected areas using visual markers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Backend: Flask (Python)
-Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy


## 🎯 Expected Impact
✅ Hospitals: Reduced HAIs, improved regulatory compliance.
✅ Healthcare Workers: Increased accountability & hygiene adherence.
✅ Patients: Lower risk of infections & improved safety.
✅ Cost Savings: Fewer infections = lower treatment costs.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions
🙅 Resistance to Change → Implement training & awareness programs.
⚙️ Technical Issues → Ensure regular maintenance & software updates.
🔐 Data Privacy Concerns → Use encrypted storage & compliance measures.
